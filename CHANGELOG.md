### Changed

- Epidemiology ODE integration refactored to use `hisab::num::rk4` when the
  `hisab` feature is enabled (4th-order accuracy, Neumaier-compensated
  accumulation). Forward Euler retained as fallback.
- `translate_codon` reimplemented as wrapper around `translate_codon_to_aa`
  (bytes-based, zero heap allocation)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Initial scaffold with all domain modules
- Full test suite with known-good reference values
- Criterion benchmarks
- CI/CD workflows
